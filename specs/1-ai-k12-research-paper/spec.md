## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Understand AI's Impact on K-12 (Priority: P1)

As an education administrator evaluating AI adoption, I want to understand the impact of AI on K-12 classroom efficiency, specifically regarding teacher workload reduction and student outcome improvements, so that I can make informed decisions.

**Why this priority**: This is the core purpose of the paper and directly addresses the target audience's need to understand the benefits of AI in K-12.

**Independent Test**: An education administrator can read the paper and articulate at least two ways AI can reduce teacher workload and two ways it can improve student outcomes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an education administrator has read the paper, **When** asked to summarize AI's benefits for K-12, **Then** they can identify 3+ concrete AI applications.
2. **Given** an education administrator has read the paper, **When** asked about the evidence supporting AI's impact, **Then** they can reference the paper's use of 8+ peer-reviewed academic sources.

### User Story 2 - Evaluate ROI of Classroom AI (Priority: P1)

As an education administrator, I want to understand the Return on Investment (ROI) of implementing AI in K-12 classrooms, so that I can justify potential investments.

**Why this priority**: This is a direct success criterion stated by the user and is crucial for the target audience to make financial justifications for AI adoption.

**Independent Test**: After reading the paper, an education administrator can confidently explain the ROI of classroom AI.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an education administrator has read the paper, **When** asked to describe the ROI of classroom AI, **Then** they can articulate the benefits and costs in a way that suggests a positive return.

### Edge Cases

- What happens if contradictory evidence is found regarding AI's impact on efficiency, teacher workload, or student outcomes? (The paper should present a balanced view, acknowledging complexities while maintaining focus on the benefits as per the prompt.)
- How is "K-12 classroom efficiency" specifically defined and measured within the paper's scope? (The paper should implicitly or explicitly define this through its chosen AI applications and evidence.)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
