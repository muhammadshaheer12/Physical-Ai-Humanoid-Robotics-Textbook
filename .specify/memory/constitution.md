# Physical-Ai-Humanoid-Robotics-Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Accuracy and Verifiability
All factual claims must be traceable to primary sources. All claims must be verified against sources before inclusion. This ensures the textbook is a reliable and authoritative source of information.

### II. Clarity and Audience Focus
The content must be written for a computer science academic audience, with a Flesch-Kincaid grade level of 10-12. This ensures the material is accessible and understandable to the target readership.

### III. Reproducibility and Traceability
All claims, findings, and results must be cited and traceable to their origins to allow for independent verification. This upholds academic integrity and allows readers to explore the source material.

### IV. Academic Rigor
A minimum of 50% of all sources must be from peer-reviewed articles. The work must maintain a high standard of academic quality. The citation format must be APA style. This is to ground the textbook in credible, validated research.
